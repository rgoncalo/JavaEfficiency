# JavaEfficiency
Master Dissertation

This is my master dissertation repository named Efficient execution of Java programs on GPU.
In this project, the performance of some kernels written in Java/Aparapi will be compared with the same versions in C++/OpenCL.
Each developed kernel has two versions, one "naive" approach and the other optimized.
The results gathered from these developed kernels will be compared with the current ones from the Parboil and SHOC benchmark suits.
